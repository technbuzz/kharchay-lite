## About
Personal Expense Management App (Pre-Alpha). This is my personal expense management. I have learned a lot from the Ionic and Angular while building it. As it is the basic need so I will just share it. All of my new learnings are experimented on this app. This app does requires some function to work properly. I yet need to find a way to make it usable.

### How to Use
Add angular environment files and update the firebase configuration. 
1. All the expenses are added to the `expense` collection of Database
2. All the expense images are stored in the `receipts/` and `receipts-next` folder of Storage. Two distinct folder are used to optimize images
